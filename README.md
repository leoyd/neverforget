<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Addon

 <img src="https://i.ibb.co/tBp8WHV/food-eso.png" width="1000" height="250">

Food buffs in eso are a very important part of your character's performance, that's why it's important to choose a quality food that will bring you the necessary status boosts to succeed in the most difficult dungeons, unfortunately sometimes we can forget about this kind of little thing that finally represents a significant gain.

That's why I had the idea to create a simple add-on, which doesn't require any library or update, it only scans the active buffs of your character and gives you a reminder when no food related buff is effective.

Simple and efficient, you have to try it to judge.
